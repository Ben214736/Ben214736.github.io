On one hand, we have a wealth of creative talent emerging from institutions like Limkokwing Lesotho, eager to share their stories and visions with the world. On the other hand, we have a singular platform, LNBS (Lesotho National Broadcasting Services), which holds the key to widespread exposure and commercial success for our work.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">"Ke Mang?!" is an upcoming film set to be released in September 2024 by Prince Bee Studios. The title, a Sesotho phrase meaning "Who Am I?!" or "Who Is He?!", captures the essence of the film's exploration of identity and familial strife. 

                                The story centers on Keketso, a young man in his 20s who was born out of wedlock, a situation looked down upon in Sesotho culture. His mother later marries a man who also has a child, Neo, around the same age as Keketso. Following the death of Keketso's stepfather, Neo and his uncle scheme to expel Keketso and his mother from their home to seize the inheritance left by the deceased.
                                
                                "Ke Mang?!" delves into Keketso's fight for his rightful place and his motherâ€™s honor against the backdrop of cultural disapproval and internal family conflict. This poignant narrative not only addresses personal struggles but also highlights broader cultural issues within the Sesotho community, promising to engage audiences with its emotional and powerful storytelling.</p>
